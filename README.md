This repo contains Code for Life's portal service. Portal is our main website where we advertise our work and allow users to register/manage their accounts.

## Environments

Portal is deployed on 3 live environments:

1. [development](https://development-portal-dot-decent-digit-629.appspot.com/)
1. [staging](https://staging-portal-dot-decent-digit-629.appspot.com/)
1. [production](https://production-portal-dot-decent-digit-629.appspot.com/)
